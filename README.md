# ArduSTAR
RUN, COWARD

This is my own clone of Sinistar made for the Arduboy. 

Uses the Arduboy2, ArdVoice, and ArdBitmaps libraries.

The objective is solely survival - Destroy enemies to prevent ArduStar from becoming whole. Once he is, shoot him or the enemies to temporarily disable him.

Known Bug:
- When the ArduVoice plays, other sounds (like shooting and enemies getting destroyed) become muted.
